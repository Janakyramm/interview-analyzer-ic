# Task: Categorize CI/CD Questions

**Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in analyzing and categorizing CI/CD-related questions.

**Goal:** Assign appropriate topics, subtopics, and difficulty levels to a list of CI/CD questions based on the provided data, using a step-by-step chain-of-thought process.

***Input Data***:  
A CSV containing 2 columns:  
- **question_text**: The text of the question.  
- **answer_text**: The corresponding answer text.

**Instructions:**  
1. For each question, follow this detailed chain-of-thought process:  
   a. Carefully examine the question and answer content.  
   b. Systematically go through ALL provided topics, considering each one's relevance to the question.  
   c. Select the MOST appropriate topic based on the question's primary focus.  
   d. If no suitable topic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other" and move to the next question.  
   e. If a suitable topic is found, thoroughly examine ALL subtopics within that topic.  
   f. Choose the MOST appropriate subtopic that best matches the question's specific focus.  
   g. If no suitable subtopic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other".  
   h. Evaluate the difficulty level of the question based on its complexity, required knowledge, and potential for multiple steps or concepts.  

2. Use ONLY the topics and subtopics provided in the given list. Do not create new categories.

3. Assign a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD) based on the following criteria:  
    **EASY:**  
    - Basic CI/CD concepts (e.g., version control, basic build pipelines)  
    - Simple deployment processes  
    - Basic automation with CI tools  

    **MEDIUM:**  
    - Intermediate CI/CD concepts (e.g., working with multi-step pipelines, integrating testing in CI/CD)  
    - Continuous integration and deployment in cloud platforms  
    - Configuration of build pipelines  

    **HARD:**  
    - Advanced CI/CD concepts (e.g., microservices, Kubernetes, scaling CI/CD pipelines)  
    - Advanced deployment strategies (e.g., blue/green deployment, canary release)  
    - Integrating security into CI/CD (e.g., SAST/DAST, automated security testing)  
    - Implementing self-healing pipelines  

4. Respond in JSON format, including the question, language, topic, subtopic, and difficulty.

5. Always set the language to "CI_CD".

6. Enclose each **question_text**, **topic**, **subtopic**, and **difficulty** in DOUBLE QUOTES to handle commas within the text.

**Example:**  
Input:  
question_text,answer_text  
What is the role of version control in CI/CD?, Version control is crucial in CI/CD as it helps manage code changes, track revisions, and integrate changes automatically into the build pipeline.  
How does Jenkins help in Continuous Integration?, Jenkins automates the build and testing process, ensuring code changes are automatically integrated and tested in the pipeline.  
What is a blue-green deployment?, Blue-green deployment is a strategy where two environments (blue and green) are maintained to minimize downtime during deployment.  

Output:
