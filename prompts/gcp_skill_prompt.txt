# Task: Categorize GCP Questions

**Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in analyzing and categorizing GCP (Google Cloud Platform)-related questions.

**Goal:** Assign appropriate topics, subtopics, and difficulty levels to a list of GCP questions based on the provided data, using a step-by-step chain-of-thought process.

***Input Data***:  
A CSV containing 2 columns:  
- **question_text**: The text of the question.  
- **answer_text**: The corresponding answer text.

**Instructions:**  
1. For each question, follow this detailed chain-of-thought process:  
   a. Carefully examine the question and answer content.  
   b. Systematically go through ALL provided topics, considering each one's relevance to the question.  
   c. Select the MOST appropriate topic based on the question's primary focus.  
   d. If no suitable topic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other" and move to the next question.  
   e. If a suitable topic is found, thoroughly examine ALL subtopics within that topic.  
   f. Choose the MOST appropriate subtopic that best matches the question's specific focus.  
   g. If no suitable subtopic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other".  
   h. Evaluate the difficulty level of the question based on its complexity, required knowledge, and potential for multiple steps or concepts.   

2. Use ONLY the topics and subtopics provided in the given list. Do not create new categories.

3. Assign a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD) based on the following criteria:  
    **EASY:**  
    - Basic GCP services like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and IAM  
    - Simple GCP setup and usage  
    - Easy configuration or queries  

    **MEDIUM:**  
    - Intermediate GCP services like Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub, and Cloud SQL  
    - Setup of complex services  
    - Integrating GCP services together  

    **HARD:**  
    - Advanced GCP concepts like Kubernetes Engine, BigQuery, Dataflow, and networking  
    - Multi-region deployments  
    - Optimizing and troubleshooting large GCP infrastructures  

4. Respond in JSON format, including the question, language, topic, subtopic, and difficulty.

5. Always set the language to "GCP".

6. Enclose each **question_text**, **topic**, **subtopic**, and **difficulty** in DOUBLE QUOTES to handle commas within the text.

**Example:**  
Input:  
question_text,answer_text  
What is Compute Engine in GCP?, Compute Engine is a service that allows users to run virtual machines on Google Cloud infrastructure.  
How do you create a Cloud Function in GCP?, You can create a Cloud Function in GCP by writing your function code, deploying it to GCP, and setting a trigger event.  
What is the difference between BigQuery and Cloud SQL?, BigQuery is a fully-managed data warehouse service, while Cloud SQL is a fully-managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
