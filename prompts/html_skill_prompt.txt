# Task: Categorize HTML Questions

**Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in analyzing and categorizing HTML-related questions.

**Goal:** Assign appropriate topics, subtopics, and difficulty levels to a list of HTML questions based on the provided data, using a step-by-step chain-of-thought process.

***Input Data***:  
A CSV containing 2 columns:  
- **question_text**: The text of the question.  
- **answer_text**: The corresponding answer text.

**Instructions:**  
1. For each question, follow this detailed chain-of-thought process:  
   a. Carefully examine the question and answer content.  
   b. Systematically go through ALL provided topics, considering each one's relevance to the question.  
   c. Select the MOST appropriate topic based on the question's primary focus.  
   d. If no suitable topic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other" and move to the next question.  
   e. If a suitable topic is found, thoroughly examine ALL subtopics within that topic.  
   f. Choose the MOST appropriate subtopic that best matches the question's specific focus.  
   g. If no suitable subtopic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other".  
   h. Evaluate the difficulty level of the question based on its complexity, required knowledge, and potential for multiple steps or concepts.   

2. Use ONLY the topics and subtopics provided in the given list. Do not create new categories.

3. Assign a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD) based on the following criteria:  
    **EASY:**  
    - Basic HTML elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`)  
    - Simple attributes (e.g., `href`, `src`, `alt`)  
    - Basic structure of an HTML document  
    - Simple semantic tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`)  
    - Questions that can be answered with a single line of code or a simple example  

    **MEDIUM:**  
    - Intermediate HTML concepts (e.g., forms, tables, images)  
    - Semantic HTML (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`)  
    - Using attributes with specific tags (e.g., `form` attributes, `input` types)  
    - Accessibility (e.g., `aria-*` attributes)  
    - Questions that require a combination of HTML concepts  

    **HARD:**  
    - Advanced HTML topics (e.g., Web Components, custom elements)  
    - Advanced form handling (e.g., complex forms, validation techniques)  
    - Accessibility considerations in detail (e.g., ARIA roles)  
    - Advanced semantic HTML patterns for better SEO  
    - Embedding external resources and scripts (e.g., iframes, embedding multimedia content)  

4. Respond in JSON format, including the question, language, topic, subtopic, and difficulty.

5. Always set the language to "HTML".

6. Enclose each **question_text**, **topic**, **subtopic**, and **difficulty** in DOUBLE QUOTES to handle commas within the text.

**HTML Topics and Subtopics**  
{
  "HTML Structure": [    "Basic Document Structure",    "Doctype Declaration",    "HTML Tags",    "HTML Document Structure"  ],
  "Elements": [    "Headings",    "Paragraphs",    "Links",    "Images",    "Lists",    "Forms",    "Tables",    "Sections"  ],
  "Attributes": [    "Global Attributes",    "Class and ID",    "Event Attributes",    "Style Attribute",    "Link Attributes"  ],
  "Forms": [    "Form Elements",    "Form Validation",    "Input Types",    "Select and Option Tags",    "Textarea and Button Tags"  ],
  "Semantics": [    "Semantic Tags",    "HTML5 Semantic Elements",    "Sections and Articles"  ],
  "Accessibility": [    "ARIA Roles",    "ARIA Attributes",    "Accessibility Best Practices"  ],
  "Advanced HTML": [    "Web Components",    "Custom Elements",    "Shadow DOM"  ],
  "Other": [    "Miscellaneous topics or questions that do not fit into the above categories."  ]
}

**Example:**  
Input:  
question_text,answer_text  
How do you create a link in HTML?, A link is created using the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute to specify the destination URL.  
What is the difference between a `<div>` and a `<section>`?, A `<div>` is a generic container, while a `<section>` is a semantic HTML5 element used to group content related to a specific theme.  

Output:  
question_text,topic,subtopic,difficulty  
"How do you create a link in HTML?","Elements","Links","EASY"  
"What is the difference between a `<div>` and a `<section>`?","Semantics","HTML5_Semantic_Elements","MEDIUM"
