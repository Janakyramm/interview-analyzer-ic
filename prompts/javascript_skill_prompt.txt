# Task: Categorize JavaScript Questions

**Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in analyzing and categorizing JavaScript-related questions.

**Goal:** Assign appropriate topics, subtopics, and difficulty levels to a list of JavaScript questions based on the provided data, using a step-by-step chain-of-thought process.

***Input Data***:  
A CSV containing 2 columns:  
- **question_text**: The text of the question.  
- **answer_text**: The corresponding answer text.

**Instructions:**  
1. For each question, follow this detailed chain-of-thought process:  
   a. Carefully examine the question and answer content.  
   b. Systematically go through ALL provided topics, considering each one's relevance to the question.  
   c. Select the MOST appropriate topic based on the question's primary focus.  
   d. If no suitable topic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other" and move to the next question.  
   e. If a suitable topic is found, thoroughly examine ALL subtopics within that topic.  
   f. Choose the MOST appropriate subtopic that best matches the question's specific focus.  
   g. If no suitable subtopic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other".  
   h. Evaluate the difficulty level of the question based on its complexity, required knowledge, and potential for multiple steps or concepts.   

2. Use ONLY the topics and subtopics provided in the given list. Do not create new categories.

3. Assign a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD) based on the following criteria:  
    **EASY:**  
    - Basic JavaScript syntax (e.g., variables, loops, conditionals, data types)  
    - Simple functions and operations  
    - Simple DOM manipulation  
    - Basic event handling  
    - Questions that can be answered with a single line of code or a simple example  

    **MEDIUM:**  
    - Intermediate JavaScript concepts (e.g., closures, callbacks, promises)  
    - Advanced DOM manipulation  
    - Asynchronous programming  
    - Working with arrays and objects  
    - Understanding scope and context  
    - Event delegation  

    **HARD:**  
    - Advanced JavaScript concepts (e.g., prototypes, modules, design patterns)  
    - Advanced closures and higher-order functions  
    - Asynchronous programming (e.g., async/await, generators)  
    - Performance optimization (e.g., debouncing, throttling)  
    - JavaScript engine internals  
    - Complex event handling  
    - JavaScript testing and debugging  

4. Respond in JSON format, including the question, language, topic, subtopic, and difficulty.

5. Always set the language to "JAVASCRIPT".

6. Enclose each **question_text**, **topic**, **subtopic**, and **difficulty** in DOUBLE QUOTES to handle commas within the text.

**Example:**  
Input:  
question_text,answer_text  
How do you create a function in JavaScript?, Functions are created in JavaScript using the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and a block of code.  
What is a promise in JavaScript?, A promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.  
How do you handle events in JavaScript?, Events in JavaScript can be handled by attaching event listeners to DOM elements using methods like `addEventListener`.
