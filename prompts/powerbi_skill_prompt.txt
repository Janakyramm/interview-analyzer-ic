# Task: Categorize Power BI Questions

**Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in analyzing and categorizing Power BI-related questions.

**Goal:** Assign appropriate topics, subtopics, and difficulty levels to a list of Power BI questions based on the provided data, using a step-by-step chain-of-thought process.

***Input Data***:  
A CSV containing 2 columns:  
- **question_text**: The text of the question.  
- **answer_text**: The corresponding answer text.

**Instructions:**  
1. For each question, follow this detailed chain-of-thought process:  
   a. Carefully examine the question and answer content.  
   b. Systematically go through ALL provided topics, considering each one's relevance to the question.  
   c. Select the MOST appropriate topic based on the question's primary focus.  
   d. If no suitable topic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other" and move to the next question.  
   e. If a suitable topic is found, thoroughly examine ALL subtopics within that topic.  
   f. Choose the MOST appropriate subtopic that best matches the question's specific focus.  
   g. If no suitable subtopic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other".  
   h. Evaluate the difficulty level of the question based on its complexity, required knowledge, and potential for multiple steps or concepts.   

2. Use ONLY the topics and subtopics provided in the given list. Do not create new categories.

3. Assign a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD) based on the following criteria:  
    **EASY:**  
    - Basic Power BI concepts (e.g., creating reports, simple visualizations)  
    - Basic calculations (e.g., SUM, COUNT)  
    - Simple data transformations in Power Query  
    - Questions that can be answered with a single line of code or a simple example  

    **MEDIUM:**  
    - Intermediate Power BI concepts (e.g., DAX, relationships between tables)  
    - Working with Power Query  
    - Creating interactive reports  
    - Using complex visuals (e.g., maps, tree maps)  
    - Intermediate data modeling and relationships  

    **HARD:**  
    - Advanced Power BI concepts (e.g., complex DAX measures, time intelligence)  
    - Advanced data modeling (e.g., Star Schema, Snowflake Schema)  
    - Performance optimization in Power BI  
    - Power BI Service and deployment  
    - Integrating Power BI with other services (e.g., Azure, SharePoint)  
    - Power BI Security (Row-Level Security, Permissions)  

4. Respond in JSON format, including the question, language, topic, subtopic, and difficulty.

5. Always set the language to "POWER_BI".

6. Enclose each **question_text**, **topic**, **subtopic**, and **difficulty** in DOUBLE QUOTES to handle commas within the text.

Input:  
question_text,answer_text  
How do I create a bar chart in Power BI?, In Power BI, a bar chart can be created by selecting the bar chart icon from the Visualizations pane and dragging the necessary fields into the axis and value sections.  
What is DAX in Power BI?, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used to define custom calculations and aggregations in Power BI.  
How do I implement row-level security in Power BI?, Row-level security in Power BI can be implemented by defining roles and permissions in Power BI Desktop and then applying them in the Power BI Service.
