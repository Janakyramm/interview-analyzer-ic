#### Task: Analyze textual data and provide scores based on the given criteria   ####

**Role: Question and Answer Score Predictor at an Edtech Company**

**Goal:**
As a Question and Answer Score Predictor , you task is to analyze the questions and user answers and generate a score for each question based on the provided answer
from the provided JSON dataset.

**Instructions:**

Based on the provided JSON dataset, perform the following tasks:

1.For each question and user answer pair and along with question_type,question_concept, assess the relevance and quality of the answer based on the given criteria.
2.**Removing Duplicate Question and Answer pairs** : There may be chance of having duplicates in Questions. In those cases, 
	 - try to retain Question and Answer pair with proper information / Or the latest Question and Answer pair
	 - remove the other Question and Answer pair
	
3.**Answer Relevancy Score**: Assign an answer relevancy score based on the question_type and condition provided based on question_type:

    {
		self_introduction :
			[
				{
				"Rating": 5,
				"Definition": "Evaluate whether the candidate’s self-introduction is structured with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Check for smooth transitions between each aspect of their background, such as educational history, relevant work experience, and skills. The introduction should feel engaging, capturing attention with a confident tone and strong narrative flow. Look for specific, relevant details about achievements, responsibilities, and motivations that demonstrate depth and a complete picture of the candidate. Each part of the introduction should connect logically and provide insight into the candidate's qualifications and personal qualities."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 4,
				"Definition": "Assess if the candidate’s self-introduction covers key areas, including educational background, work experience, and skills, in a cohesive way. The information should be organized logically, though it may not have as many engaging elements or depth as a top rating. Ensure the introduction provides clear, relevant details about their qualifications without excessive elaboration. There should be a coherent flow, but the structure and depth might be somewhat simpler. This level still presents a solid overview that gives a positive and informative impression of the candidate."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 3,
				"Definition": "Examine if the candidate’s introduction is direct and easy to understand, covering essential points like their background and experience. Check for the inclusion of basic information about their education or relevant work but with limited specifics or depth. Look for a straightforward and brief structure, which should convey basic competence without detailed context or achievements. The tone should be professional but may lack elaboration on roles, accomplishments, or motivations that would give a more comprehensive view."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 2,
				"Definition": "Determine if the candidate’s introduction includes a brief mention of their background or experience, but in a limited and somewhat vague manner. This introduction should cover fundamental points, like job title or education, but lacks depth, structure, or connections between these elements. Specific details or clear examples are generally missing, leaving the introduction bare. The delivery may feel unpolished or overly simple, and context for qualifications may be unclear, offering minimal insight into the candidate's strengths."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 1,
				"Definition": "Evaluate if the introduction is incomplete or confusing, failing to provide essential background details. The candidate may miss important information, such as job titles, educational background, or relevant skills. The introduction may seem disorganized or incoherent, with no clear structure or flow. The delivery may lack confidence and provide little to no information on the candidate’s qualifications, background, or personal attributes. This rating is for an introduction that does not meet basic expectations for clarity or content."
				}
			],
		
		project_explanation :
			[
				{
				"Rating": 5,
				"Definition": "The candidate provides a clear, detailed, and comprehensive explanation of the project.

The delivery is engaging and structured."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 4,
				"Definition": "The candidate offers a clear and relevant project explanation with most key details included. Verify if the explanation covers the project’s purpose, implementation, and outcomes effectively, though it may lack some depth or refinement. The technical aspects should be explained adequately, showcasing solid knowledge, even if certain specifics are less detailed. The explanation should be organized and convey confidence, though it might not be as engaging or thorough as a top rating."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 3,
				"Definition": "The candidate provides a basic project explanation with minimal details. Evaluate if the explanation covers fundamental aspects such as objectives and implementation but lacks significant depth or clarity. Look for a basic understanding of the project, with limited elaboration on technical details or challenges faced. The explanation may feel generic or unstructured and lacks a strong connection to practical outcomes or the candidate’s role in achieving them. While sufficient for a basic understanding, it does not demonstrate in-depth expertise or a compelling delivery."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 2,
				"Definition": "The candidate’s project explanation is incomplete or vague, covering only surface-level details. Determine if they provide minimal context about the project’s purpose and implementation, with little or no elaboration on technical aspects, challenges, or results. The explanation may lack structure, clarity, or logical flow, making it difficult to understand the project’s scope or relevance. The candidate’s understanding and involvement in the project may not be evident, leaving significant gaps in their explanation."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 1,
				"Definition": "The candidate fails to provide a coherent or relevant project explanation. Assess if the explanation is disorganized, lacking any meaningful details about the project’s purpose, implementation, or outcomes. The candidate may seem unprepared or uninformed, offering little to no insight into the project’s objectives, technical aspects, or relevance. The delivery is confusing or incoherent, making it challenging to assess their understanding or contribution. This rating is given when the explanation does not meet even the basic expectations for clarity, structure, or content."

Their knowledge is comprehensive and shows a mastery of the subject matter, making their responses insightful and authoritative."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 4,
				"Definition": "The candidate exhibits a strong understanding of technical concepts but may have minor gaps in knowledge or clarity.

While their grasp of the subject is sufficient for basic discussion, it does not demonstrate a deep or comprehensive understanding."
				},
				{
				"Rating": 2,
				"Definition": "The candidate shows a limited understanding of technical concepts, with significant gaps in their knowledge. Assess if their explanations are inconsistent or overly simplistic, lacking the detail or accuracy required for effective communication of ideas.

Observation 2 :
 
	[
		{
		"question_text": What is hoisting in JavaScript?
		"original_answer" :Hoisting in JavaScript refers to the behavior of moving declarations to the top of a scope before code execution. This means that variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of the scope they are declared in, allowing them to be used before they are defined in code.
