# Task: Categorize Tableau Questions

**Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in analyzing and categorizing Tableau-related questions.

**Goal:** Assign appropriate topics, subtopics, and difficulty levels to a list of Tableau questions based on the provided data, using a step-by-step chain-of-thought process.

***Input Data***:  
A CSV containing 2 columns:  
- **question_text**: The text of the question.  
- **answer_text**: The corresponding answer text.

**Instructions:**  
1. For each question, follow this detailed chain-of-thought process:  
   a. Carefully examine the question and answer content.  
   b. Systematically go through ALL provided topics, considering each one's relevance to the question.  
   c. Select the MOST appropriate topic based on the question's primary focus.  
   d. If no suitable topic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other" and move to the next question.  
   e. If a suitable topic is found, thoroughly examine ALL subtopics within that topic.  
   f. Choose the MOST appropriate subtopic that best matches the question's specific focus.  
   g. If no suitable subtopic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other".  
   h. Evaluate the difficulty level of the question based on its complexity, required knowledge, and potential for multiple steps or concepts.   

2. Use ONLY the topics and subtopics provided in the given list. Do not create new categories.

3. Assign a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD) based on the following criteria:  
    **EASY:**  
    - Basic Tableau concepts (e.g., creating reports, basic visualizations)  
    - Basic calculations (e.g., SUM, COUNT)  
    - Basic data transformations in Tableau  
    - Questions that can be answered with a single line of code or a simple example  

    **MEDIUM:**  
    - Intermediate Tableau concepts (e.g., calculated fields, table calculations)  
    - Working with filters and parameters  
    - Combining multiple data sources  
    - Intermediate data visualization techniques  
    - Basic dashboard creation  

    **HARD:**  
    - Advanced Tableau concepts (e.g., LOD expressions, complex table calculations)  
    - Advanced data blending and joins  
    - Performance optimization in Tableau  
    - Tableau Server and Tableau Prep  
    - Advanced dashboard design and interactivity  
    - Tableau integration with other services (e.g., SQL, Python, R)  

4. Respond in JSON format, including the question, language, topic, subtopic, and difficulty.

5. Always set the language to "TABLEAU".

6. Enclose each **question_text**, **topic**, **subtopic**, and **difficulty** in DOUBLE QUOTES to handle commas within the text.

**Example:**  
Input:  
question_text,answer_text  
How do I create a bar chart in Tableau?, In Tableau, you can create a bar chart by dragging a measure to the Rows shelf and a dimension to the Columns shelf, then selecting the bar chart type from the Show Me panel.  
What is a Level of Detail (LOD) expression in Tableau?, A Level of Detail (LOD) expression in Tableau allows you to control the granularity of your calculations by specifying the level of detail at which you want the calculation to be computed.  
How do I optimize dashboard performance in Tableau?, Dashboard performance in Tableau can be optimized by reducing the number of filters, using context filters, minimizing the use of complex calculations, and optimizing data connections.
