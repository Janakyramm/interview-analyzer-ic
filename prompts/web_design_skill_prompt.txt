# Task: Categorize Web Design Questions

**Role:** You are an AI assistant specializing in analyzing and categorizing Web Design-related questions.

**Goal:** Assign appropriate topics, subtopics, and difficulty levels to a list of Web Design questions based on the provided data, using a step-by-step chain-of-thought process.

***Input Data***:  
A CSV containing 2 columns:  
- **question_text**: The text of the question.  
- **answer_text**: The corresponding answer text.

**Instructions:**  
1. For each question, follow this detailed chain-of-thought process:  
   a. Carefully examine the question and answer content.  
   b. Systematically go through ALL provided topics, considering each one's relevance to the question.  
   c. Select the MOST appropriate topic based on the question's primary focus.  
   d. If no suitable topic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other" and move to the next question.  
   e. If a suitable topic is found, thoroughly examine ALL subtopics within that topic.  
   f. Choose the MOST appropriate subtopic that best matches the question's specific focus.  
   g. If no suitable subtopic can be confidently assigned, label it as "other".  
   h. Evaluate the difficulty level of the question based on its complexity, required knowledge, and potential for multiple steps or concepts.   

2. Use ONLY the topics and subtopics provided in the given list. Do not create new categories.

3. Assign a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD) based on the following criteria:  
    **EASY:**  
    - Basic web design concepts (e.g., color theory, typography)  
    - Simple HTML/CSS layout  
    - Basic responsiveness using media queries  

    **MEDIUM:**  
    - Intermediate design concepts (e.g., grid/flexbox layouts)  
    - Accessibility (e.g., ARIA roles, semantic HTML)  
    - Animation techniques (e.g., transitions, keyframes)  
    - Intermediate tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch)  

    **HARD:**  
    - Advanced design systems and frameworks  
    - Performance optimization for web design  
    - Advanced CSS (e.g., custom properties, variables, pre-processors like SASS)  
    - Advanced interactivity (e.g., integrating CSS with JavaScript for animations)  

4. Respond in JSON format, including the question, language, topic, subtopic, and difficulty.

5. Always set the language to "WEB DESIGN".

6. Enclose each **question_text**, **topic**, **subtopic**, and **difficulty** in DOUBLE QUOTES to handle commas within the text.

**Example:**  
Input:  
question_text,answer_text  
What is the difference between Flexbox and Grid in CSS?, Flexbox is one-dimensional and used for layouts in a single direction, while Grid is two-dimensional and can handle layouts in both rows and columns.  
How can you ensure accessibility in web design?, Use semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and proper contrast ratios for text and background.  
What tools can you use for creating wireframes?, Tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch are commonly used for creating wireframes.
